This is the source for the RUKTS GRF for OpenTTD.

Overview

Representative UK Train Set (RUKTS) is a GRF for OpenTTD designed to give a variety of British railway traction in any customisable format. The main feature of RUKTS is the freedom that the parameters give to the user. Given the parameters, the graphics will change in 4 combinations. The parameters are either 2cc liveries or the ability to choose liveries. If 2cc is on, then the colours of the liveries will appear in game as the 2 company colours decided by the user in their in-game company. If turned off, then they will use the real life colours of the used liveries. When Manual Liveries is turned on, the user has the choice to manually choose the livery used by each train/locomotive (like BR trains), whereas if it is turned off then the livery will change depending on what year the train/locomotive is built.
