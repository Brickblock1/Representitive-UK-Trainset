-- 0.0 INTRODUCTION --
	
Representative UK Train Set (RUKTS) is a GRF for OpenTTD designed to give a variety of British railway traction in any customisable format. The main feature of RUKTS is the freedom that the parameters give to the user. Given the parameters, the graphics will change in 4 combinations. The parameters are either 2cc liveries or the ability to choose liveries. If 2cc is on, then the colours of the liveries will appear in game as the 2 company colours decided by the user in their in-game company. If turned off, then they will use the real life colours of the used liveries. When Manual Liveries is turned on, the user has the choice to manually choose the livery used by each train/locomotive (like BR trains), whereas if it is turned off then the livery will change depending on what year the train/locomotive is built.

	0.1 Features

	RUKTS offers a variety of features across different rolling stock. Some features apply to every train: the option to choose the livery from a selection of real life liveries, the ability to switch between real life colours and company colours, and running costs that vary with the amount of time spent running. Other features are rolling stock specific, from limited coupling interoperability and "magic" reversing to rare liveries and bi-mode operation.

-- 1.0 PARAMETERS --

There are 9 parameters.

	1.1 Real Livery Colours
	
	This parameter toggles whether locomotives, multiple units and passenger coaches use company colours (2CC) or the real life livery colours associated with whichever livery may be applied to the train.
	
	1.2 Wagons Use Real Colours
	
	This paramater toggles whether wagons use company colours (2CC) or the real life livery colours. This is a seperate parameter as players may want to make their freight trains distinct from others.
	
	1.3 Choose Liveries Manually
	
	This parameter toggles whether train liveries can be selected through the cargo refit menu. If set to off, the livery will automatically change to one that is year appropriate.
	
	1.4 Vehicle Selection
	
	This parameter decides the range of vehicles available to the player. This is by default set to Normal, which gives enough variety for RUKTS to be played from around 1960 until 2020 with a good selection of vehicles. With Extended selected, players get a wider range of their favourite trains, but may find some overlap in the range of vehicles; unhelpful if the purchase list has a lot of other vehicles. Reduced and Minimal give just a flavour of the set, ideal for use in combination with other sets.
	
	1.5 Use Class Names
	
	This parameter toggles the type of name shown for each vehicle. When this parameter is not set, the vehicle names will be generic family names for types of train. When this is set, the purchase list will display train classes instead.
	
	1.6 Purchase Cost Factor
	
	Sets the multiplier for the purchase cost. An easy way to scale the difficulty of the set.
	
	1.7 Running Cost Factor
	
	Sets the multiplier for the purchase cost. An easy way to scale the difficulty of the set.
	
	1.8 Sort By Class Number
	
	By default trains are sorted first by type (Locomotive, Multiple Unit, Wagon), then by propulsion (Steam, Diesel, Electric). With this parameter engaged, the sort is entierly by class number.
	
	1.9 Sound Effects
	
	Select the train sounds for the trains in the set.
	
-- 2.0 THE TRAINS --

As of version 60 (11th October 2021) this set has 106 vehicles. The text in brackets next to the train's name indicates the minimum Vehicle Selection parameter required to be able to acess the type of train
